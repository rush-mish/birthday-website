Tumhare saare sapne sach hon. Tumahara jivan khushiyon aur safalta se bhara rahe. And may you live an amazing life, on your terms, as the fabulous person I've had the honor of knowing ❤️">1.</p>

        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="Mujhe bohot pasand hai ki tum khud, mujhe, aur apne around har vyakti ko growth ki ore push karte ho. I've never met anyone else like you. Tumhare saath hone mein aur keep up karne ka jo challenge hai na - I'm addicted to it. If there is ever one thing I hope never changes about you, its this. ">3.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="Mujhe tumhari physical strength dekh ke aur feel kar ke kuch kuch aur bohot kuch hota hai. I love the stiffness of your body. My Ironman. I love the fact that your a sports guy, and have many bruises / callouses. Makes you 20 times more desirable.">4.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="I love that you're a voracious reader. How you get completely greedy when you're around books. Remember in Mumbai - how you went into the book seller's van and wouldn't come out. You looked so adorable then. Reading around you, being read to by you - are one of my fav activites that we do together. BTW the next session better happen soon. You're so cute my book hoarder.">5.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="Mujhe tumhari awaaz bohot pasand hain. Jaise jab bhagwaan tumhari voice ko tune kar rahe the unhone ek aisa perfect pitch select kiya bilkul mere liye custom. Jaise agar bohot noise hai toh tumhari awaaz mere liye ek anchor hai. I love your morning voice, your baby voice, your normal voice, even your sad and angry tones and all the other tones. Mujhe kisi aur ki awaaz itni comforting and pasand kabhi nahi aayi.">6.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="Mujhe humesha adorable aur funny lagta hai ki tum kaisi jo bhi meri seemingly cool cheezein hoti hain wahi chahiye hoti hai.<br> Eg1: Meri night light. <br> Eg2: Mera gaming keyboard. <br> Eg3: Mera octopus toy aur potlu<br> Mujhe isme Chota Adi dikhta hai aur humesha mann karta hai ki tumhe jo bhi chahiye main laa ke doon. Tumhara childishness aur mujhpe aisa trust ki tum apna yeh side mujhse reveal karte ho tumhe mere liye bohot special banata hai.">7.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="It's still a mystery to me as to why animals are ALWAYS drawn to you. I don't love it cuz let's be honest hum dono mein se agar unhe koi dher saara attention dega toh woh main hi hoon, par, keeping aside that feeling, I love seeing you interact with animals. Hoshi comes to mind. Kaise humesha tumhare paas dauda aa jaata tha. Kowsalya ke saath jab tum hang out kar rahe the mumbai mein, kaise woh ekdum tum pe rub kar rahi thi, aur hangout kar rahi thi. Chotu kaise uss kitten ko ek cloth rag jaise carry around kar raha tha haha. Tum mein ek type ki nonchalance hai inn situations mein joh mujhe observe karna amusing lagta hai. Aisa sochti hoon inn moments pe ki damn he's so cool.">9.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="I thoroughly enjoy your sense of humor. Except when it becomes too poo poo centered. Being around you is fun, even when you go off into one of your adhikaans smth smths. But seriously, you're a fun guy.">10.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="Hey Sexy, zara paas toh aao. Aur mud jao. Let me get some well deserved me time with my fav buns. BBB forever.">11.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="Listening to your insights sometimes feels so illegal. Like mujhe life ki important cheezonn ki cheatcode mil gayi ho. Tum bohot perceptive aur clear thinker ho. Long term ki cheezien, short term mein unke steps, apne interest ki cheezien - sab tum consolidate kar ke mere paas le aate ho. Aisa allowed hai kya? I'm so greatful tum aisa karna choose karte ho. I'd be lying if I don't admit ki tumhara help mere liye significant raha hai to be the person I am and you love today. Thank you. I find your intelligence very attractive.">12.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="I enjoy seeing your creativity in play. Whether its through your stories or through your cooking or through your design thinking - in fashion, business ideas. Tum ek gajab ideas ki factory ho yaar, kaise kar lete ho aisa? Aur jab tumhara dil kisi idea pe aa jaata hai toh uske ekdum peeche pad jaate ho - jaise itne samay se writing kar rahe, bouldering as a sport pasand aaya toh woh kar rahe. It's inspiring to me.">13.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="You're the first fashionable man I've known personally. That's crazy to me. You have an amazing fashion sense. Tum jis type ke shoes, chain pehente ho. Jis type ke kapde pehente ho - you're quite knowledgable in this domain. Tum jaise apne aap ko groom karte ho aur present karte ho, even when you're just lounging is just muah. And not just tumhare, par mere cheezon mein bhi tumhare thoughts valuable paati hoon.">14.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="How do you smell amazing all the time? Like I'm not even kidding - all the time. It's inhuman. I love your smell. I miss that scent. Come close soon.">15.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="From time to time, you make me feel all kinds of weak in the knees. I think about doing unspeakable things and getting done unspeakably by you. When you come close, and make a sort of growling sound in your throat, and touch me in places no one else ever has, I feel like misbehaving, just so I can be punished for being a bad girl. Your body looks and feels so masculine, your big, strong, textured hands on my soft small body, trying to enter holes too small for them is the best feeling. Your check and back, your legs, stomach, arms - my goodness. You're so hot. (I'm going to have to take a break now)">16.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="If there was an award for Best Listener - I'd give it to you. Talking to you is one of my fav things about my day. The way you patiently sit through my meadow reports and instantly summarise the gist of what I might have been talking about for a long time in 1 sentence astonishes and annoys me sometimes. You have really good comprehension skills imo. I'm always grateful that you make time for me. I know its not always easy. Thank you.">17.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="In almost the 3 years that I've known you, one thing hasn't changed much. You've always taken initiative and been proactive in most domains of your life and still are. No matter how the situation makes you feel, at the end you deal with it your way. I truly admire that about you.">18.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="I love the unique way your mind works, especially when it comes to art. The way you perceive music, the details you catch in movies—it’s like you see the soul of the story. I could listen to you talk about your theories forever.<br> On that note, I want you to listen to the slow song on this page. Pay attention to the lyrics. A lot of it makes me think of you.">19.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="You've grown into the kind of man with true jigra. It takes real courage to chase the things you want. You face challenges head-on, and I admire that fire in you more than anything. I love your guts (and your heart!). I'm so proud of you Adi.">20.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="Tum dil ke acche ho aur fair ho. I love that about you. Bhooke bacche ko khana de dete ho, stray animals ke liye doodh le aate ho, khud tired hone ke baavjoot mere liye present hote ho. Jaanti hoon tum kuch situations mein selfish hona seekh rahe ho aur main usse undermine nahi kar rahi, wahan tumhara growth hai, aur yeh tumhara part. I love your different shades.">21.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="Tum ek bohot solid dost ho and ek bohot high quality partner. I feel lucky to have you in my corner ❤️">22.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="*5 things I dont like about u to balance things out*<br> 1. Tum mujhse 10,000km dur ho. I hate it.<br> 2. Tumne ab tak kabhi nahi bola ki sweety agar hum shaadi karte hain toh tum kaam nahi karogi(so unfair!)<br>3. Ki tum humesha insist karte ho ki tum gaadi chalaoge. Please. Chup chaap mere passenger prince banke raho, isime tumhari bhalaai hai.<br>4. Tum mere bina India chale gaye. Bohot bure ho (PS. My life since then has never been better ahahaha).<br>5. This one is from a little fat guy whom you've banned from surfacing. Tum boooooot dura hai, lots of bunny kicks and cat swats on you. Mai da ra hoon.">23.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="Tum kaafi brave aadmi ho. Tum apne emotions express karne se katrate nahi. Main luck feel karti hoon ki tum mere paas apne problems leke aana pasand karte ho. Tumhare kathin samay mein tumhara saath dena mujhe apne aur tumhare baare mein accha feel karata hai. Mujhe tum jaisa hi emotionally available aur vulnerable partner chahiye tha. Thank you ispe khoob kaam karne ke liye. I know easy nahi tha. Main tumhe jab emotional dekhti hoon toh tum ekdum jaise chai mein doobe hue biscuit jaise lagte ho ekdum carefully handle karne ka mann karta hai. I love you, I'll take care of you.">24.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="*Astrology reading for Aditya*<br> My distant darling, you are a Scorpio. While the physical miles are long, your chart shows that your mind is permanently orbiting my zip code. Your energy is currently focused on The Great Countdown until we close the distance.<br>Your chart indicates a powerful Moon-Link, meaning that even thousands of miles apart, you possess an alarming ability to sense when I've had a bad day (or when I'm doing something that I shouldn't be doing).<br>Cosmic Challenge: To stop watching the clock during our calls. The cosmos demands your full, undivided attention.<br>Prediction: Your ruling star foretells that your next big decision will involve purchasing a ticket to see me. The entire solar system is holding its breath.<br>Happy Birthday, my Sun, Moon, and most persistent satellite. I love you! ❤️">25.</p>

        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="*You have to make me some promises*<br>1. Tum humesha apne khoob khayal rakhoge aur ensure karoge ki you're around for the longest time (non-negotiable).<br> 2. Tum ek publised author banoge and kabhi writing nahi chodoge (I want to read your books in my book club with my gals and see them on the bestseller board) <br> 3. Promise karo ki tum mujhe atleast weekly once (ideally more) apne haath ka bana khana khilaoge.<br> 4. Tum mujhe apni award winning muskaan aur awaaz sunne ka priviledge for the longest time doge. <br> 5. Hum jab saath aayege tum mujhe kabhi chodke nahi jaoge.">28</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="I love you Mr.Sinha. Apko mere dher saare kisses, hugs aur shubhkamnaen ❤️">29.</p>
        <p class="message-item" data-full-message="Tumhara chehra jab dekhti hoon na Mr.Sinha, uff. Tumhara maatha, naak, aankein, moustache, beard, kaan, skin color, texture, shine, tumhare plump lips, kya kahoon. Har ek hisse se meri aankein guzarti hain toh mann hi nahi bharta, baar baar wapas aane ka jeeh karta hai. Aur agar iss beech tum muskura do toh jaise seene mein ek adrinaline rush sa feel hota hai aur mann mein endorphins aur serotonin ka release. Tumhe idea nahi mere liye tumhe dekhte hue gussa rehna kitna zyada kathin kai. Tum bohot handsome ho. I love the color and shape of your eyes and how they shine in the light. Kaise tumhari aankhein nasheeli ho jaati hain - ek jab tum beemaar hote ho aur doosra jab tum mood mein hote ho. If I had to choose my fav 2 features of your face - it would be your eyes and lips and beard and nose and skin... oops can't choose.">8.</p>
